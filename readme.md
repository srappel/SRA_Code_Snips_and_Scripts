# My personal code snip library

This is a place where I store my random code snips for various projects. None of these things are guaranteed in any way. Some of the code is not mine and may in fact be protected. I'm happy to remove any code that you claim is your intellectual property, just let me know.

Most of it is Python or some kind of script.
